## Purpose

Have you been curious about writing code? Have you tried to get started but just couldn't get things to work? Have you heard that python is a great language to learn but not sure where to start? These workshops got you covered.  

In this workshop, we will cover:
- Getting you set up for success and continued learning after class
- How to use git to version control your work
- What is github and why is it helpful for collaborating on teams

We will start with the basics of how to use the commandline to navigate around the folders on your computer, create files, carefully remove files, move / copy files and compress / zip them.

In the git section, we will learn the basics of using git for version control to save your work and rescue you when you manage to break something.

As for github, we will introduce you to the purpose of github and demonstrate why is it incredibly popular for the software development community. In this section, we will show you how to copy project repositories to your local computer and how to use the commandline to push up your saved work to your public project.

## Why It's Great to Learn Python

:snake: It's free. You can download it for free, there are ways to learn it for free, and there's a whole range of packages available for free.

:snake: It's easy. Other languages make you remember strange commands or keep track of curly braces everywhere. Not so with Python. That makes it a great beginner programing language.

:snake: It's everywhere. It's a powerful language that is used by a wide variety of companies and organizations to solve all sorts of problems.

:snake: It's community-focused. Python exists solely because of volunteers and has a great community both online and off that connects people.
