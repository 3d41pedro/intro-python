## Why It's Great to Learn Python

:snake: It's free. You can download it for free, there are ways to learn it for free, and there's a whole range of packages available for free.

:snake: It's easy. Other languages make you remember strange commands or keep track of curly braces everywhere. Not so with Python. That makes it a great beginner programing language.

:snake: It's everywhere. It's a powerful language that is used by a wide variety of companies and organizations to solve all sorts of problems.

:snake: It's community-focused. Python exists solely because of volunteers and has a great community both online and off that connects people.
